# nameinfo.sh
Check every kind of DNS-record for a domain, check a couple of common TXT-records, robots file and whois

Just another quick script to check info on a domain, sometimes useful for CTF's.

Add more power by combining with gitGet.sh and well-known.sh, maybe I'll bundle these up one day...
